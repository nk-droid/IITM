## Characteristics of MP Neuron

- The first computational neuron.
- Implements linearly separable boolean functions.

## Limitations of MP Neuron

- Works only for boolean inputs.
- Threshold needs to be handcoded.
- Not able to give more importance to some inputs.
- Not able to implement non-linearly separable functions.
