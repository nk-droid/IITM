### DBDFS Algorithm

```
1   OPEN ðŸ¡¨ (S, null) : []
2   CLOSED ðŸ¡¨ empty list
3   while OPEN is not empty
4       nodePair ðŸ¡¨ head OPEN
5       (N, _, depth) ðŸ¡¨ nodeTriplet
6       if GoalTest(N) = True
7           return ReconstructPath(nodePair, CLOSED)
8       else CLOSED ðŸ¡¨ nodeTriplet : CLOSED
9           if depth < depthBound
10               children ðŸ¡¨ MoveGen(N)
11              newNodes ðŸ¡¨ RemoveSeen(children, OPEN, CLOSED)
12              newTriplets ðŸ¡¨ MakeTriplets(NewNodes, N)
13              OPEN ðŸ¡¨ newTriplets ++ (tail OPEN)
14          else OPEN ðŸ¡¨ tail OPEN
15  return empty list
```

**Functions used**

-   RemoveSeen - Removes from nodeList any nodes that are already in OPEN or in CLOSED
-   MakePairs - Makes a triplet (head(nodeList), parent, depth)
-   ReconstructPath - Traces back through Parent links and reconstructs the path found.
