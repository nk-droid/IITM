### DBDFS2 Algorithm

```
1   count ðŸ¡¨ 0
2   OPEN ðŸ¡¨ (S, null, 0) : []
3   CLOSED ðŸ¡¨ empty list
4   while OPEN is not empty
5       nodeTriplet ðŸ¡¨ head OPEN
6       (N, _, depth) ðŸ¡¨ nodeTriplet
7       if GoalTest(N) = True
8           return (count, ReconstructPath(nodePair, CLOSED))
9        else CLOSED ðŸ¡¨ nodeTriplet : CLOSED
10          if depth < depthBound
11              children ðŸ¡¨ MoveGen(N)
12              newNodes ðŸ¡¨ RemoveSeen(children, OPEN, CLOSED)
13              newTriplets ðŸ¡¨ MakeTriplets(NewNodes, N)
14              OPEN ðŸ¡¨ newTriplets ++ (tail OPEN)
15              count ðŸ¡¨ count + length newTriplets
16          else OPEN ðŸ¡¨ tail OPEN
17  return (count, empty list)
```

**Functions used**

-   RemoveSeen - Removes from nodeList any nodes that are already in OPEN or in CLOSED
-   MakePairs - Makes a triplet (head(nodeList), parent, depth)
-   ReconstructPath - Traces back through Parent links and reconstructs the path found.
