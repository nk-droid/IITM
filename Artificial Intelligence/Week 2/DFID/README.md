### DFID Algorithm

```
1   count ğŸ¡¨ -1
2   path ğŸ¡¨ empty list
3   depthBound ğŸ¡¨ 0
4   repeat
5       previousCount ğŸ¡¨ count
6       (count, path) ğŸ¡¨ DBDFS2(S, depthBound)
7       depthBound ğŸ¡¨ depthBound + 1
8   until (path is not empty) or (previousCount = count)
9   return path
```

**Function used**

- DBDFS2 - Implements [DBDFS2 algorithm](../DBDFS2/).
