### DFS Algorithm

```
1   OPEN ðŸ¡¨ (S, null) : []
2   CLOSED ðŸ¡¨ empty list
3   while OPEN is not empty
4       nodePair ðŸ¡¨ head OPEN
5       (N, _) ðŸ¡¨ nodePair
6       if GoalTest(N) = True
7           return ReconstructPath(nodePair, CLOSED)
8        else CLOSED ðŸ¡¨ nodePair : CLOSED
9           children ðŸ¡¨ MoveGen(N)
10          newNodes ðŸ¡¨ RemoveSeen(children, OPEN, CLOSED)
11          newPairs ðŸ¡¨ MakePairs(NewNodes, N)
12          OPEN ðŸ¡¨ NewPairs ++ (tail OPEN)
13  return empty list

```

**Functions used**

-   RemoveSeen - Removes from nodeList any nodes that are already in OPEN or in CLOSED
-   MakePairs - Makes a pair (head(nodeList), parent)
-   ReconstructPath - Traces back through Parent links and reconstructs the path found.
